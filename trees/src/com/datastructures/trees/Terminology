The tree elements are called "nodes". 
The lines connecting elements are called "branches". 
Nodes without children are called leaf nodes, "end-nodes", or "leaves".

Every finite tree structure has a member that has no superior. This member is called the "root" or root node. 
The root is the starting node. But the converse is not true: infinite tree structures may or may not have a root node.

the term "uncle" is still used for other nodes at the same level as the parent.
"Sibling" ("brother" or "sister") nodes share the same parent node.

A node's "uncles" are siblings of that node's parent.
A node that is connected to all lower-level nodes is called an "ancestor". The connected lower-level nodes are "descendants" of the ancestor node.


Ancestor of a node v: Any node, including v itself, on the path from the root to the node
Proper ancestor of a node v: Any node, excluding v, on the path from the root to the node


Descendant of a node v: Any node, including v itself, on any path from the node to a leaf node (i.e., a node with no children)
Proper descendant of a node v: Any node, excluding v, on any path from the node to a leaf node

Siblings: Nodes that have the same parent

Degree: The number of subtrees of a node

Leaf: A node with degree 0
Internalor interior node: a node with degree greater than 0

Level (or depth) of a node v: The length of the path from the root to v.
Height of a node v: The length of the longest path from v to a leaf node.
The height of a tree is the height of its root mode.
By definition the height of an empty tree is -1

N ary follows that the degree of each node in an N-ary tree is at most N
